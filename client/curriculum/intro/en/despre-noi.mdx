FrontendCademy is a community of people who are learning FrontEnd from scratch.

The community revolves around a series of free lessons and exercises that we believe constitute the foundations of a modern career in FrontEnd Development. Although only in the <span className="line-through">first</span> second iteration, these will be rewritten, re-rewritten, and re-re-rewritten based on your feedback until they become one of the highest quality resources of their kind in Romania.

<section>
  {<LessonHeading as="h2" id={CONFIG.chapters[1].id}>
    {CONFIG.chapters[1].title}
  </LessonHeading>}

  We are convinced that:

  {<LessonQuote variant="centered">
    It doesn't matter how many tutorials you watch, but how much you code
  </LessonQuote>}

  However, when you learn on your own, it's a bit harder to know if the solution you found is the best one. So you will send us your exercise solutions here, and we - experienced developers from the community - will give you feedback for each one.
</section>
<section>
  {<LessonHeading as="h2" id={CONFIG.chapters[2].id}>
    {CONFIG.chapters[2].title}
  </LessonHeading>}

  From the beginning, we wanted FrontendCademy to be a <strong>community effort, for the community</strong>. The lessons, exercises, this website, and the feedback you will receive are all voluntary contributions from big-hearted developers from Romania.

  We want to offer the chance for as many people as possible to learn and work in this field, one of the coolest in the world, which is why we won't put a price on this experience.
</section>
<section>
  <LessonHeading as="h2" id={CONFIG.chapters[3].id}>

  If you're using this platform to <strong>learn FrontEnd</strong> and feel that it has helped you, it might be helpful to your friends too. We would greatly appreciate it if you could share it so that we can have a greater impact:

  <div className="d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
    <OptionsDrawer trigger={{ text: "Share", icon: SCOPE.icons.faShare }}>
      <OptionsDrawer.Element className="bg-white">
        <CopyLinkButton text={SCOPE.urlToShare} />
      </OptionsDrawer.Element>
      <OptionsDrawer.Element className="bg-white">
        <FacebookButton url={SCOPE.urlToShare} />
      </OptionsDrawer.Element>
      <OptionsDrawer.Element className="bg-white">

      <OptionsDrawer.Element className="bg-white">
        <WhatsAppButton url={SCOPE.urlToShare} />
      </OptionsDrawer.Element>
    </OptionsDrawer>
  </div>

  And after you advance your skills and gain more experience, we would really appreciate it if you came back here, this time as a mentor and give back to the community. ðŸ˜„

  If you're a <strong>FrontEnd Developer</strong>, then you can help us by giving feedback to the students, creating exercises and lessons or developing this platform whose code is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href={SCOPE.GITHUB_URL}>open-source on GitHub</a>.

  And if you're a <strong>tech company and like what we're trying to do here</strong>, maybe we can find a way to collaborate and help each other and the community at the same time.

  FrontEnd, and programming in general, is a constantly evolving and changing field. Every month new things come up, and in a few years the tools we use may be completely different. This makes things extremely interesting, but also a little complicated when you want to learn this field...

  However, the fundamentals of FrontEnd don't change, and you'll use them whether you're building a presentation website, an online store, or the next Instagram. That's why we'll focus here on the fundamentals of the 3 programming languages that make up FrontEnd: <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. For now, we only have lessons and exercises for the first one, HTML, but after a round of feedback from the community, we'll continue with the other two as well.
</section>
<div className="dots" />
<section>
  <LessonHeading as="h2" id={CONFIG.chapters[5].id}>
    {CONFIG.chapters[5].title}
  </LessonHeading>

  Our focus is on exercises and feedback, that's where we invest the most time. There are already a lot of extremely good articles and tutorials on the internet, so we decided that the lessons should only represent a <strong>brief summary</strong>, which will have <strong>links to more detailed resources</strong> at the end. For this reason, the main responsibility for learning is yours.

  {<LessonQuote>
    We expect you to be motivated and self-taught, to be able to understand the concepts on your own.
  </LessonQuote>}

  To learn as much as possible, start with lesson 0 (the one you're reading now) and continue in order with each new lesson. Read our summary, then take a look at the additional resources before starting the exercises.

  <strong>It is very important to complete all the exercises from each lesson.</strong> Be patient and trust us, we haven't loaded the site with useless exercises.

  Then, after you send us your solution, we will move on to the <strong>feedback phase</strong>. As a beginner, there will probably be somewhere around 3-4-5 rounds, in which we will explain to you why certain things are not good and ask you to change them.

  It is extremely important to {' '} <strong>be patient with this process, and not be too hard on yourself</strong>. Enjoy having someone to do Code Review for you and learn from them. Many of us didn't have this chance. And again:

  {<LessonQuote variant="centered">
    Don't be too hard on yourself. Don't take it personal. We are here to help you. ðŸ˜„
  </LessonQuote>}

  </LessonHeading>

  One of the coolest things about FrontEnd development is that we don't need too much before we start. First of all, a <strong>calculator</strong> and an <strong>internet connection</strong>.

  Then, specifically for this domain, you need:

  <List as="ol" variant="count">
    {<li>
      <strong>a modern and cross-platform browser</strong> (that can be installed on Windows, MacOS, and Linux).

      <p> We recommend one of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Microsoft Edge</a>.

      It doesn't really matter which one of the 3 you install, they're all good.
      </p>
    </li>}
    {<li>
      <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>: the program where we will actually write the code.
      <p>
        This editor is extremely popular among developers, so let's use it right from the start to get familiar with it.

        Also, before you start <a href="/html/despre-html">Lesson 1</a>, we invite you to take a look at this <a href="/intro/vs-code">mini-tutorial about VSCode</a>.
      </p>
    </li>}
  </List>
  <div className="dots" />
</section>
<section>
  <LessonHeading as="h2" id={CONFIG.chapters[7].id}>
    {CONFIG.chapters[7].title}
  </LessonHeading>
  
  In the resources section, we will add links at the end of each lesson where you can learn more. However, we cannot fail to mention two extremely useful sites that make the job of a FrontEnd developer much less frustrating:

  {<List as="ol" variant="count">
    <li>
      <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" className="text-bold">MDN - Mozilla Developer Network</a>
      {' '}
      is the place where we find the most qualitative and detailed documentation about HTML,
      CSS and JavaScript - the 3 languages that make up FrontEnd development.
      <p>
        The field is so complex that it is perfectly normal not to remember everything.
        It is much more common than you think for experienced developers to forget
        syntax things, i.e. what piece of code they should use to
        achieve a certain result.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, we may have forgotten how to change the background color
        of an element on the page, in which case we will search for
        {' '}
        <FormattedText as="span">background color MDN</FormattedText>
        .
        We recommend putting "MDN" at the end so that the searched page
        appears among the first results.
      </p>
      <LessonFigure
        withBorder
        src="/images/lesson-0__google-search.png"
        alt="Searching for `background-color MDN` on Google"
      />
      <p>
        And voilÃ ! We have arrived at the documentation,
        where we can see all the possible options and how we can use them:
      </p>
      <LessonFigure
        withBorder
        src="/images/lesson-0__mdn.png"
        alt="The `background-color` documentation on MDN"
      />
    </li>
    <li>
      <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" className="text-bold">Stack Overflow</a>
      {' '}
      is a community of developers who learn and code together.
      <p>
        More specifically, it is the most popular programming question and answer platform, used by most developers in the world. Without this site, it would take us much longer to find solutions to the various bugs/problems we encounter when coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you're curious, you can take a look at the latest questions added for the languages we will learn here:
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html">HTML</a>,
        <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/css">CSS</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript">JavaScript</a>
        .
